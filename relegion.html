					<h3>Ramayana, translated by Kamala Subramaniam</h3>
					<p class="summery">
						The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic which follows Prince Rama’s quest to rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana with the help of an army of monkeys... Comprising 24,000 verses in seven cantos, the epic contains the teachings of the very ancient Hindu sages. One of the most important literary works of ancient India, it has greatly influenced art and culture in the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia, with versions of the story also appearing in the Buddhist canon from a very early date. The story of Rama has constantly been retold in poetic and dramatic versions by some of India’s greatest writers and also in narrative sculptures on temple walls. It is one of the staples of later dramatic traditions, re-enacted in dance-dramas, village theatre, shadow-puppet theatre and the annual Ram-lila (Rama-play).

				<h3>Mahabharata, translated by Kamala Subramaniam</h3>
				<p class="summery">
					The Mahabharata is an important source of information on the development of Hinduism between 400 bce and 200 ce and is regarded by Hindus as both a text about dharma (Hindu moral law) and a history (itihasa, literally “that’s what happened”). Appearing in its present form about 400 ce, the Mahabharata consists of a mass of mythological and didactic material arranged around a central heroic narrative that tells of the struggle for sovereignty between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra, the descendant of Kuru) and the Pandavas (sons of Pandu).

				<h3>The Holy Geeta, by Swami Chinmayananda</h3>
				<p class="summery">
					Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Divine Song of the Lord), is the most popular and probably the single most influential text in Hindu philosophy. It is a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. It comprises of 700 verses in eighteen chapters (chapter 25 to 42) occurring in the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata. Holy Gita is a handbook of instructions as to how every human being can come to live the subtle philosophical principles of Vedanta in the actual work-a-day world... Although there are many commentaries on the Gita, it is the careful analysis and brilliant reasoning of Swami Chinmayananda’s version that makes it so exceptional. There is a constant attempt to bring forth from each verse not only its literal meaning, but also its hidden import that reveals a wealth of information. Each verse is given in Devanagari along with its translation in English and the Commentary by Swami Chinmayananda
