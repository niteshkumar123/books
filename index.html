					<h3>Clean code : A Handbook of Aglie Software Craftsmanship</h3>
					<p class="summery">
						Programming is about polishing the craft with years of trial and error. I wish there was a way to save yourself from all the hard work by learning from the mistakes of other programmers? Fortunately, there is, and it is known to the world as the Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship book from the legendary Uncle Bob.</p>
						<p class="summery">
						The clean code offers invaluable insights into code cleaning and software development. It has thorough, step-by-step explanations on cleaning, writing, and refactoring code. The programming book has a galore of practical examples about the how and why of writing clean code.</p>
						<p class="summery">
						Post successful completion of the Clean Code book, you will be able to effortlessly implement Agile methodology, one of the leading forms of SDLC, in your software development projects. Also, you will find yourself to be a more resolute, disciplined programmer than before

				<h3>Introductions to Algorithms</h3>
				<p class="summery">
					The name of the book is self-explanatory. It is what the title suggests, i.e., Introduction to Algorithms. Also known as CLRS, a reference to the last name of the authors of the book, it goes in-depth into a range of algorithms divided across several self-contained chapters</p>
					<p class="summery">
					All the algorithms discussed in the Introduction to Algorithms book are amply explained. They are presented using pseudocode, readable by programmers of all skill levels, even those who are relatively new to programming.</p>
					<p class="summery">
					The third edition of the Introduction to Algorithms book is comprehensively revised and updated. It adds two new chapters:
